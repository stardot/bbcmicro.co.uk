	<p>In 1981, after <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-15969065" class="postlink">winning a contract from the BBC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Computers" class="postlink">Acorn Computers</a> released the 8-bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro" class="postlink">BBC Micro</a>. It was used in most schools in the UK, and many of us who were in school at the time remember the computer fondly.</p>
        <p>We have been lovingly restoring BBC Micro games from the 1980s onwards. We have put them here so you can play them in emulators, or on a real BBC Micro, or in your browser. If you would like to help us improve the site, please <a href="contact.php">contact us</a>.</p>

          <p>Which game should you play? There are more than 3000 games on the website, but which are the very best? At the <a href="http://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=8259">Stardot forum</a>, members nominated their favourite games. Here are the top twenty:</p>

          <h2>Status</h2>
          <p>The site is still under development. We believe we have most of the games written for the BBC Micro apart from a few very obscure ones which we are still trying to track down. If you know of a game we have missed, or, even better, if you own one, <a href="/contact.php">contact us</a> and we will get it added to the database. We maintain a list of titles which we believe to be <a href="http://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=14458">missing from the archive</a>.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>Purpose</h2>
          <p>We strive for ease of use rather than the exact preservation of original releases. Games on tape have been transferred to disc-images so that they will load quickly. And changes have been made to enhance usability — see the <i>Who we are</i> section for more details. Any major changes have been noted on a per-game basis. </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>Thanks</h2>
          <p>In addition to the people who worked on the archive and the website, we would like to say a big <strong>thank you</strong> to <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MattGodbolt">Matt Godbolt</a> for developing <a href="http://bbc.godbolt.org">JSBeeb</a> and sharing it with the world on <a href="https://github.com/mattgodbolt/jsbeeb">GitHub</a>. It makes the website come alive — anyone can play BBC Micro games right in the browser!</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
       </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
           <h2>Who we are</h2><p>
Most of the games on this website were originally curated by Mick Brown, who announced the <a href="https://sweh.spuddy.org/Beeb/MB_Collection/">30th Anniversary BBC & Electron Collection</a> in 2014 and started releasing disc-images <a href="http://www.stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=8270">on the Stardot forum</a> in May of that year. 
</p><p>
The collection is made up of games that Mick had first copied to his own "unofficial" compilation discs thirty years before. 
</p><p>
Mick has enhanced the games by fixing bugs, adding user-friendly instructions (taken from cassette inlays or other authentic sources), and ensuring that the games are compatible with a range of emulators as well as real Acorn hardware.
</p><p>
Our thanks go to Mick for the countless hours of work he has put into compiling, enhancing, testing, and re-testing the games in this collection.
</p><p>
Thanks also to Paul Houghton and Richard Toohey for developing the bbcmicro.co.uk website, Gary for hosting it, and Mark Moxon for ongoing development. 
</p><p>
Lee "Eagle Eye" Newsome proofread the game instructions, tested every game several times, and coordinated the work on the website project, aided and abetted by "lurkio" at Stardot.
</p><p>
Huge thanks to Dave Moore ("Arcadian" at Stardot) for his enduring commitment to preserving and promoting all things Acorn, online and off, including the creation of the invaluable <a href="http://www.stairwaytohell.com">Stairway To Hell</a> archive and the <a href="http://abug.org.uk/">ABug</a> video series. 
</p><p>
We're grateful to the incredibly knowledgeable members of the Stardot forum for their generous help and support.
